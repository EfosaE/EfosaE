I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable systems, solving real-world problems, and writing clean, maintainable code.

With expertise in **Go**, **Node.js**, **NestJS**, and **React**, I specialize in crafting efficient APIs and microservices alongside fluid, responsive user interfaces. I'm deeply curious and enjoy learning the inner workings of software systems — from infrastructure to UI.
